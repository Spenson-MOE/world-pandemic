A Pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease that spreads across a large geographic region and affects a considerable number of theworld's population. Pandemics spread globally and span several periods. Increased infectiousness, human-to-human transfer, andcontemporary mobility all contribute to the fast spread.
This project aims to explore the prevalence and trends of major infectious diseases using a dataset containing annual records for diseasessuch as polio, guinea worm disease, rabies, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.
The dataset provides valuable information on:
Temporal trends, enabling an understanding of how disease cases have evolved over time.
Regional variations, revealing geographic patterns in disease prevalence.
Disease-specifi c metrics, highlighting areas of concern and success in public health efforts.
This analysis aims to leverage data insights to inform health policy, allocate resources effi ciently, and contribute to the global fight against infectious diseases.
